Client TODO
- Event loop and error handling, as described in TODO inline 

Server TODO
- Create Express server, to be hosted on HTTPS Herokuapp. Maybe use yo generator for express?
- Bake in some rudimentary authentication, like a client secret.
- Two API endpoints: 'POST /users/:id/photos' and 'GET /users/:id/photos'
   aka CREATE and READ
- GET: Use LRANGE with Redis to get last 60.
- POST: Use LPUSH. Format will be imgur URL + imgur delete hash, delimited by something like ||
	If COUNT > 60, then RPOP(60+) and delete those images with IMGUR delete hash

TODO later: Multi-user ability
